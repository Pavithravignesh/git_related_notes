we don't mutate the state in action fn(), while using vanialla redux and you have to return
in reduxToolkit, actually you have to mutate the to work with the action fn(), inside to reducers at the slice, here you don't have to return any,

And for special mention, nothing has eliminated here, but reduxTool kit does it with immer library

every simply, it's all how to deep copy a obj and making the change over there?

a feature/bug - create separate branch and create PR, once done, follows as to another,
